In Linux, groups are collections of users. Creating and managing groups is one of the simplest ways to deal with multiple users simultaneously, especially when dealing with permissions. The /etc/group file stores group information and is the default configuration file.

Linux admins use groups to assign access to files and other resources. Every group has a unique ID listed in the /etc/group file, along with the group name and members. The first groups listed in this file are system groups because the distribution maintainers preconfigure them for system activities.

Each user may belong to one primary group and any number of secondary groups. When you create a user on Linux using the useradd command, a group with the same name as the username is also created, and the user is added as the group's sole member. This group is the user's primary group.

## Create and modify groups
To add a group in Linux, use the groupadd command:

```bash
  $ sudo groupadd demo
```
When a group is created, a unique group ID gets assigned to that group. You can verify that the group appears (and see its group ID) by looking in the /etc/group file.

If you want to create a group with a specific group ID (GID), use the --gid or -g option:

## Add and remove users from a group

Suppose you have existing users named user1 and user2, and you want to add them to the demo group. Use the usermod command with the --append --groups options (-a and -G for short):

To add a group in Linux, use the groupadd command:

```bash
$ sudo usermod --append --groups demo user1 

$ sudo usermod -aG demo user2
```

Look in the /etc/group file or use the id command to confirm your changes:

```bash
$ id user1
uid=1005(user1) gid=1005(user1) groups=100(users),1009(demo)
```

To remove a specific user from a group, you can use the gpasswd command to modify group information:

```bash
$ sudo gpasswd --delete user1 demo
```
Alternatively, manually edit the /etc/group file and remove the user from any number of groups.

## Delete a group
When a group is no longer needed, you delete it by using the groupdel command:
```bash
$ sudo groupdel demo
```

# Module 04 .  File Folder Permissions
File permissions are core to the security model used by Linux systems. They determine who can access files and directories on a system and how. This article provides an overview of Linux file permissions, how they work, and how to change them.

## How do you view Linux file permissions?

The ls command along with its -l (for long listing) option will show you metadata about your Linux files, including the permissions set on the file.

```bash
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root    68 Jun 13 20:25 tuned
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  4017 Feb 24  2022 vimrc
```

In this example, you see two different listings. The first field of the ls -l output is a group of metadata that includes the permissions on each file. Here are the components of the vimrc listing:

  - File type: -
  - Permission settings: rw-r--r--
  - Extended attributes: dot (.)
  - User owner: root
  - Group owner: root

The fields "File type" and "Extended attributes" are outside the scope of this article, but in the featured output above, the vimrc file is a normal file, which is file type - (that is, no special type).

The tuned listing is for a d, or directory, type file. There are other file types as well, but these two are the most common. Available attributes are dependent on the filesystem format that the files are stored on. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, and 9, the default filesystem format is XFS.

## How do you read file permissions?

This article is about the permission settings on a file. The interesting permissions from the vimrc listing are:

```bash
rw-r--râ€“
```

This string is actually an expression of three different sets of permissions:

  - rw-
  - r--
  - r--

The first set of permissions applies to the owner of the file. The second set of permissions applies to the user group that owns the file. The third set of permissions is generally referred to as "others." All Linux files belong to an owner and a group.

When permissions and users are represented by letters, that is called symbolic mode. For users, u stands for user owner, g for group owner, and o for others. For permissions, r stands for read, w for write, and x for execute.

## What are octal values?

When Linux file permissions are represented by numbers, it's called numeric mode. In numeric mode, a three-digit value represents specific file permissions (for example, 744.) These are called octal values. The first digit is for owner permissions, the second digit is for group permissions, and the third is for other users. Each permission has a numeric value assigned to it:

  - r (read): 4
  - w (write): 2
  -  x (execute): 1

In the permission value 744, the first digit corresponds to the user, the second digit to the group, and the third digit to others. By adding up the value of each user classification, you can find the file permissions.

For example, a file might have read, write, and execute permissions for its owner, and only read permission for all other users. That looks like this:

-   Owner: rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
-   Group: r-- = 4+0+0 = 4
-   Others: r-- = 4+0+0 = 4

The results produce the three-digit value 744.

## What do Linux file permissions actually do?

I've talked about how to view file permissions, who they apply to, and how to read what permissions are enabled or disabled. But what do these permissions actually do in practice?

# Read (r)

Read permission is used to access the file's contents. You can use a tool like cat or less on the file to display the file contents. You could also use a text editor like Vi or view on the file to display the contents of the file. Read permission is required to make copies of a file, because you need to access the file's contents to make a duplicate of it.
# Write (w)

Write permission allows you to modify or change the contents of a file. Write permission also allows you to use the redirect or append operators in the shell (> or >>) to change the contents of a file. Without write permission, changes to the file's contents are not permitted.
# Execute (x)

Execute permission allows you to execute the contents of a file. Typically, executables would be things like commands or compiled binary applications. However, execute permission also allows someone to ru
